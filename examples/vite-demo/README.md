# Vite demo

1. Run the build script (because "vite-plugin-retrying-dynamic-important" is not running on dev).
2. Run the preview script.
3. Disable the internet and click "Page One."
4. Enable the internet and click "Page One" again.
5. "Page One" will be loaded. It's not the same as the default behavior of dynamic import.
